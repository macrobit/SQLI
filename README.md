# SQLI
Lecture ppt and hands-on tutorial

Author: Yuhao Fei

This repository includes one lecture ppt with recording, two hands-on tutorial documents, and a quize document.
I designed and wrote these documents with the help of Teresa, my supervior, and used them to give a popular 
lecture about SQL language and SQL injection. 

In this lecture, I used Acunetix Web Vulerability Scanner to present a demo to help student understand how to 
use a tool to analyze SQLI faults and test several tricks of SQL injection.
